# ERP_System

The app is ERP system, which has client viev and backend server. You can directoring persons, creating account to login and do CRUD operation on persons and items and filter items by warehouses. Client app was created in JavaFX technology. Backend server was created in Java with spring framework, maven, lombok and jpa. Data base has been created in MySQL. Connecting client app with backend server is done with http protocole in REST architecture. I used postman to test backend server. 
Backend server is in other repository - name --> "Backend_ERP_System".
